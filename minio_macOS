*Minio Installation on macOS

**Fresh Install

Installing Minio packages for macOS is done via brew. 
```
brew install minio/stable/minio
minio server ~/Photos
```

**Upgrade 

Minio used to be available on macOS with a simple `brew install minio`

Step 1: Uninstall minio if you installed it using `brew install minio`
```
brew uninstall minio 

```
Step 2: Fresh Install using new path

Once you remove minio completely from your system, proceed to do :

```
brew install minio/stable/minio
```

Minio does not work with go 1.8 because of upstream bugs in golang such as https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19734.
We will re-enable minio installation on macOS via `brew install minio` as these fixes become available to us in go 1.8.1
